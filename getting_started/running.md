Pakyow includes a tool for running projects locally during development. To start the
server, run the following command in terminal from the main directory of your project:

    console:
    pakyow server

You should see some ouput similar to this:

    console:
    Puma 2.7.1 starting...
    * Min threads: 0, max threads: 16
    * * Environment: development
    * * Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000
