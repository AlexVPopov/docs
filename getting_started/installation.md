Pakyow is easy to install, but needs a modern version of
the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language.
You can check the state of your system by running this
command in your terminal:

    console:
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pakyow/pakyow-deps/master/check.sh)

Here are some additional links that might be helpful:

  - [Download Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
  - [Download RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/pages/downloads)

Once everything checks out, install Pakyow via RubyGems:

    console:
    gem install pakyow

That's it! Pakyow is installed and ready to rumble.
