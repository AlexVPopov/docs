Hello! These docs will guide you through the details of building a
website or web app with Pakyow. The next few pages will explain how
to get your local environment up and running, how to create a new
project, etc.

Once you're off and running, checkout the [Warmup](/docs/warmup),
which is more of a crash course in building your first Pakyow project.
In just a few minutes you'll build an app and deploy it so you can show
your friends and coworkers!
