Hello! Thanks for stopping by, we're excited that you want to take a few minutes
to build your very first web app in Pakyow. This warmup will guide you through
all the high-level concepts you'll find in Pakyow. Together, we'll build a
simple app with realtime traffic counters and a simple chat tool. Once it's
built, we'll deploy it to Heroku for all the world to see.

So you know what to expect, this warmup will take about half an hour. You'll
walk away with an app of your own that you can show your friends, along with an
understanding of how Pakyow works.
